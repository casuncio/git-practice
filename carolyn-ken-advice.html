                    <li><h2>Code <strong>EVERYDAY.</strong></h2></li>
                
                    <p>It doesn't matter if you spend 10 minutes and just write a few lines of code. This is a matter of building
                        trust in yourself and discipline. You're learning a new way of thinking and if you step away from too long it will 
                        be hard to start back up - it's like running the mile in school. Even if you're running slow, keep going.
                    </p>

                    <li><h2>Find a Good Teacher and a Supportive Community.</h2></li>
                
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, coding is a collaborative 
                        activity (at least when you're learning). At some point you will get stuck and need questions answered.
                        While it's great to Google things and that will get you far, you might get easily discouraged if you get 
                        stuck and can't find the answers so best have someone around to help! Skillcrush offers both these things! 
                    </p>

                    <li><h2>Be Kind to Yourself</h2></li>

                    <p>Coding can be hard, so don't be ashamed if you have to re-read things or back and
                        re-watch videos or find and read and watch other sources. This isn't a race and the more 
                        you take time, concepts will solidify in your head. 
                    </p>

                    <li><h2>Practice, Practice Practice </h2></li>
                
                    <p>You need practice to get concepts to stick in your head. If there is additional practice, or 
                        optional projects, do them!
                    </p>
                
                    <li><h2>Don't Give Up.</h2>
                    </li>
                    <p>In problem solving, you never know when the problem is just a missing ; or >! Keep going! It will be so satisfying when you 
                        find the answer.
                    </p>
